# Work History Entry

> **REMINDER:** After drafting and user validation, remove all guideline parenthesis (e.g., '(must match filename)'), the validation checklist below, and the final checklist at the end before commit. The final entry should be clean and free of template guidance.

_Date_: [YYYY-MM-DD] (must match filename)
_Commit_: #[XXX-branchname] (must match filename, 3 digits + full branch name)
_Commit Title_: [type(scope): description]

Validation:
- [ ] Date format matches filename
- [ ] Commit number matches filename and branch
- [ ] Title follows commit message format
- [ ] All required sections are filled
- [ ] For merges: source branch and commits are documented

## Changes Made
[Describe the specific changes made, focusing on what was actually modified. This can be a bullet list, numbered list, or paragraphs depending on what best describes the changes]

## Technical Details
[Include any relevant technical information, such as:
- Code changes
- Configuration updates
- Dependencies affected
- Performance considerations
- Security implications
- Any other technical aspects that are important to document]

## Testing
[Describe if the changes were tested, and if it was how the changes were tested, including:
- Test cases covered
- Environments tested
- Results observed
- Any issues found and resolved]

- Known limitations
- Special considerations
- References to other documentation
- Incomplete work or pending tasks
- Discarded attempts and explorations during the development]

## Documentation Principles

1. **Be Specific**: Include exact file paths, versions, and configurations when relevant
2. **Be Complete**: Document all significant changes, even if they seem minor
3. **Be Clear**: Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
4. **Be Contextual**: Explain why changes were made, not just what was changed
5. **Be Practical**: Focus on information that will be useful for:
   - Future debugging
   - Understanding the change
   - Reverting if needed
   - Maintaining the code
6. **Be Honest**: Document both successes and failures
7. **Be Organized**: Structure information logically and consistently
8. **Be Relevant**: Only include information that adds value to understanding the change
9. **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't repeat information across sections. If something is mentioned in one section, reference it in others rather than repeating it.
