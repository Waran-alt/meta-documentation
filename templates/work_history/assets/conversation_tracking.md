## Usage Guidelines
1. **Before Each Response**:
   - Read this file to understand context
   - Check current focus and goals
   - Review recent changes, and if needed, propose to update the history entry
   - Verify active tasks
   - Get current datetime using system command
   - Update Last Check timestamp with actual time (format: dd-MM-yyyy HHh UTC)

2. **After Each Response**:
   - Get current datetime using system command
   - Add new changes with actual timestamp (format: dd-MM-yyyy HHh UTC)
   - Note any new decisions with actual time (format: dd-MM-yyyy HHh UTC)
   - Update active tasks
   - Adjust next steps
   - Maintain context window
   - **Do not delete any previous changes or steps until the work is committed.**

3. **When Stuck**:
   - Review recent changes
   - Check original goals
   - Verify current focus
   - Ask for clarification, ask user to review the current goals in this file
   - Consider breaking task into smaller steps

4. **For Long Tasks**:
   - Break into smaller steps
   - Track progress
   - Document decisions
   - Maintain context
   - Update timestamps with actual time (format: dd-MM-yyyy HH UTC)

5. **DateTime Handling**:
   - Always get current time using system command before updates
   - Never use hardcoded timestamps
   - Use consistent format: "dd-MM-yyyy HH UTC" (date+hour only)
   - Update all timestamps in a single edit
   - Verify time accuracy before committing changes

6. **When creating an entry**:
   1. Explain how a cyber-security expert might criticize the current commit 
   2. Criticize the current changes from a professional point of view, focusing on best practices
   3. Share your honest thoughts about the current state of work and propose new ideas or suggest next steps
